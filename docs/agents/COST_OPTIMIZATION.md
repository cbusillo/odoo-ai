# Cost Optimization Implementation Guide

This document provides concrete strategies for optimizing Claude model costs while maintaining development quality in our agent-based workflow.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Optimizations (Week 1)
- Deploy model assignments in CLAUDE.md
- Update key agent documentation with model selection examples
- Monitor usage patterns for baseline establishment

### Phase 2: Fine-tuning (Weeks 2-3)
- Analyze actual cost/performance data
- Adjust model assignments based on real usage
- Implement dynamic selection keywords

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Week 4+)
- Deploy auto-selection logic
- Set up cost monitoring dashboards
- Refine based on monthly usage patterns

## Cost Monitoring Framework

### Key Metrics to Track

**Monthly Costs by Model**:
```
Haiku 3.5: 
- Target: $10-15/month (high-volume operations)
- Monitor: Request frequency, average context size

Sonnet 4:
- Target: $40-60/month (standard development)
- Monitor: Success rate, refactoring frequency

Opus 4:
- Target: $60-90/month (complex reasoning)
- Monitor: Problem resolution rate, architecture decisions
```

**Performance Indicators**:
- **First-try success rate** by model and agent
- **Context efficiency** (tokens per successful completion)
- **Task completion time** by complexity level
- **Cost per successful feature implementation**

### Usage Pattern Analysis

**Daily Operations (Expected Distribution)**:
- **Haiku 3.5**: 60% of requests (container ops, searches, simple tasks)
- **Sonnet 4**: 30% of requests (code writing, analysis)
- **Opus 4**: 10% of requests (architecture, complex debugging)

**Cost per Request (Estimated)**:
- **Haiku 3.5**: $0.05-0.15 per complex request
- **Sonnet 4**: $0.25-0.75 per standard request
- **Opus 4**: $1.50-4.50 per complex request

## Agent-Specific Optimization Strategies

### High-Volume Agents (Optimize for Speed)

**üö¢ Dock Agent**:
```python
# Current: All Haiku 3.5 (optimal)
# Savings: 80% vs using Sonnet 4 for everything
# Quality impact: Minimal (container ops are straightforward)

# Optimization: Batch operations
Task(
    description="Bulk container operations",
    prompt="@docs/agents/dock.md\n\nModel: haiku-3.5\n\nCheck status, restart failed containers, update logs for all services",
    subagent_type="dock"
)
```

**üèπ Archer Agent**:
```python
# Current: Haiku 3.5 for searches, Sonnet 4 for analysis
# Opportunity: 90% of searches can stay on Haiku
# Quality check: Ensure complex pattern recognition works

# Optimization: Batch research queries
archer_results = Task(
    description="Comprehensive research",
    prompt="@docs/agents/archer.md\n\nModel: haiku-3.5\n\nFind patterns for: [list of 5-10 patterns]",
    subagent_type="archer"
)
```

### Medium-Complexity Agents (Balance Cost/Quality)

**üîç Scout Agent**:
```python
# Optimization strategy: 
# - Simple CRUD tests ‚Üí Haiku 3.5
# - Standard functionality tests ‚Üí Sonnet 4 (default)
# - Complex integration tests ‚Üí Opus 4

def estimate_test_complexity(requirements):
    """Estimate test complexity for model selection"""
    simple_indicators = ["CRUD", "basic", "single model", "validation"]
    complex_indicators = ["integration", "multi-tenant", "workflow", "API"]
    
    if any(term in requirements for term in complex_indicators):
        return "opus-4"
    elif any(term in requirements for term in simple_indicators):
        return "haiku-3.5"
    return "sonnet-4"  # Default
```

**ü¶â Owl Agent**:
```python
# Optimization strategy:
# - CSS fixes, simple styling ‚Üí Haiku 3.5
# - Component development ‚Üí Sonnet 4 (default)
# - Complex component architecture ‚Üí Opus 4

# Example batch optimization
frontend_fixes = [
    ("Fix button styling", "haiku-3.5"),
    ("Create form component", "sonnet-4"),
    ("Build dashboard system", "opus-4")
]
```

### High-Impact Agents (Optimize for Quality)

**üêõ Debugger Agent**:
```python
# Strategy: Quality first, but optimize simple cases
# - Log review ‚Üí Sonnet 4 (downgrade from Opus)
# - Stack trace analysis ‚Üí Opus 4 (maintain quality)
# - Performance debugging ‚Üí Opus 4 (critical)

# Cost optimization example
def select_debugger_model(error_type, context_size):
    if error_type in ["syntax", "import", "configuration"]:
        return "sonnet-4"  # Downgrade from Opus
    elif error_type in ["race condition", "memory leak", "performance"]:
        return "opus-4"  # Critical quality
    return "opus-4"  # Default to quality for debugging
```

## Budget Management Strategies

### Monthly Budget Allocation ($135 target)

**Conservative Distribution**:
- **Fixed costs** (20%): $27 - Essential operations that must run
- **Development** (60%): $81 - Active feature development
- **Optimization** (20%): $27 - Quality improvements, refactoring

**Weekly Budget Tracking**:
- Week 1-2: 30% of monthly budget (front-loaded development)
- Week 3: 40% of monthly budget (peak development)
- Week 4: 30% of monthly budget (optimization/cleanup)

### Cost Control Mechanisms

**Daily Spending Caps**:
- **Haiku 3.5**: $2/day maximum (high-volume operations)
- **Sonnet 4**: $8/day maximum (standard development)
- **Opus 4**: $12/day maximum (complex reasoning)

**Weekly Review Process**:
1. **Monday**: Review previous week's costs and patterns
2. **Wednesday**: Mid-week checkpoint, adjust if over budget
3. **Friday**: Week summary, plan next week's model usage

**Alert Thresholds**:
- **Yellow**: 75% of weekly budget reached
- **Red**: 90% of weekly budget reached
- **Emergency**: Switch all non-critical tasks to Haiku 3.5

## Quality vs Cost Trade-offs

### Acceptable Quality Reductions

**Low-Risk Downgrades**:
- Container operations: Opus ‚Üí Haiku (minimal quality impact)
- Simple file operations: Sonnet ‚Üí Haiku (almost no impact)
- Basic syntax checks: Sonnet ‚Üí Haiku (linting catches issues)

**Medium-Risk Optimizations**:
- Standard test writing: Sonnet ‚Üí Haiku (for very simple tests)
- Basic debugging: Opus ‚Üí Sonnet (for common error patterns)
- Simple code reviews: Sonnet ‚Üí Haiku (with human oversight)

**Never Compromise**:
- Architecture decisions (always Opus 4)
- Complex debugging (always Opus 4)
- Performance optimization (always Opus 4)
- Security reviews (always Opus 4)

### Quality Monitoring

**Success Rate Targets**:
- **Haiku 3.5**: 90%+ for assigned simple tasks
- **Sonnet 4**: 85%+ for standard development tasks
- **Opus 4**: 90%+ for complex reasoning tasks

**Quality Indicators**:
- Tests pass on first run
- Code compiles without errors
- Minimal rework required
- Architecture decisions hold over time

## Optimization Techniques

### Batch Processing

**Research Batching** (Archer):
```python
# Instead of 5 separate Haiku requests ($0.25)
# One combined request ($0.05)
research_batch = """
Find patterns for:
1. Controller inheritance
2. Model field definitions  
3. View template structure
4. Service layer patterns
5. Test organization
"""
```

**Code Review Batching** (Inspector):
```python
# Instead of file-by-file Sonnet reviews ($2.50)
# One project-wide analysis ($0.75)
bulk_review = """
Analyze entire product_connect module for:
- Import consistency
- Code style issues
- Performance patterns
- Security concerns
"""
```

### Context Optimization

**Efficient Prompts**:
```python
# ‚ùå Expensive: Large context with full file contents
prompt = f"@docs/agents/scout.md\n\n{full_file_content}\n\nWrite tests"

# ‚úÖ Efficient: Focused context
prompt = "@docs/agents/scout.md\n\nWrite tests for Motor model: fields (name, brand, power), methods (calculate_efficiency)"
```

**Smart Context Loading**:
```python
# ‚ùå Always load all subdocs
prompt = "@docs/agents/scout.md\n@docs/agents/scout/test-templates.md\n@docs/agents/scout/tour-patterns.md"

# ‚úÖ Load subdocs only when needed
if complexity == "high":
    prompt += "\n@docs/agents/scout/test-templates.md"
```

### Parallel Processing

**Independent Task Distribution**:
```python
# Run multiple simple tasks in parallel with Haiku
tasks = [
    Task("Check container status", dock_agent, model="haiku-3.5"),
    Task("Search for patterns", archer_agent, model="haiku-3.5"),
    Task("Review syntax", inspector_agent, model="haiku-3.5"),
]

# One complex task with Opus
architecture_task = Task("Design system", planner_agent, model="opus-4")
```

## ROI Analysis

### Cost/Benefit Calculation

**Development Speed Improvements**:
- **Agent-based workflow**: 3-5x faster than manual
- **Proper model selection**: Additional 20-30% efficiency
- **Net benefit**: 4-6x faster development at 60% of single-model cost

**Quality Improvements**:

- **Net benefit**: 40% fewer iterations, 25% fewer bugs

**Monthly Value Calculation**:
```
Time Saved: 40 hours/month √ó $100/hour = $4,000
