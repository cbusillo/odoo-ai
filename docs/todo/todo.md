# TODO / Optimization Ideas

- Optimize motor product generation (create_motor_products):
    - Profile product template matching and creation loops; consider batched create calls and prefetching related.
    - Avoid repeated name_search/read_group calls; fetch once per run.
    - Consider server-side job queue if generation exceeds ~30â€“60s on typical datasets.
    - Add progress bus events to update UI while processing.
