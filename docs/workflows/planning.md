title: Planning Workflow
---


## Purpose

Keep planning small and tied to real code changes.

## Workflow

1. Identify the smallest change that delivers value.
2. Locate the existing model/view/service code to extend.
3. List acceptance checks (inspection + tests).
4. Batch work into small, reversible patches.

## Sources of Truth

- `docs/workflows/codex-workflow.md` — plan → patch → inspect → test.
- `docs/policies/coding-standards.md` — top-level rules.
- `docs/odoo/orm.md` — ORM sources of truth.
