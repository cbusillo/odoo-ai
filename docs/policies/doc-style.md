title: Doc Style (LLM‑Friendly)
---


Goals

- Small topic pages with stable anchors. Prefer linking by handle.

Structure

- Front‑matter uses YAML with `title` (and optional Purpose, When to Use, Applies To, Inputs/Outputs, References,
  Maintainers, Last Updated).
- Short headings; minimal examples; consistent anchor names.

Handles

- Use path+anchor: @docs/odoo/orm.md#recordsets; avoid pasting large excerpts.
