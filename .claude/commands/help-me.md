Based on your request, I'll automatically choose the best agent:

REQUEST: $ARGUMENTS

Let me analyze this and route to the appropriate specialist...

<!-- Claude will analyze the request and choose:
- Debugger: For errors, tracebacks, "not working"
- Planner: For "implement", "add feature", "design"
- Refactor: For "clean up", "update all", "make consistent"
- Archer: For "how does", "find examples", "research"
- Scout: For "write tests", "test failing"
- Inspector: For "check quality", "find issues"
- Dock: For "container", "docker", "logs"
- Shopkeeper: For "shopify", "sync", "graphql"
- Owl: For "frontend", "javascript", "component"
-->

I'll use the most appropriate agent for this task.
