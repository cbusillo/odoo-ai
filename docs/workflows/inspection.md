title: Inspection Workflow Sources of Truth
---


## Purpose

This page points to the real inspection workflow docs and avoids duplicating
procedures.

## Sources of Truth

- `docs/tooling/inspection.md` — inspection commands, scopes, and results.
- `docs/workflows/codex-workflow.md#working-loop` — where inspections fit in
    the loop.
- `docs/policies/acceptance-gate.md` — zero-warning gate requirements.
- `docs/roles/reviewer.md` — review responsibilities and triage flow.
