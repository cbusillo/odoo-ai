Title: Doc Style (LLM‑Friendly)

Goals

- Small topic pages with stable anchors. Prefer linking by handle.

Structure

- Front‑matter: Title, Purpose, When to Use, Applies To, Inputs/Outputs, References, Maintainers, Last Updated.
- Short headings; minimal examples; consistent anchor names.

Handles

- Use path+anchor: @docs/odoo/orm.md#recordsets; avoid pasting large excerpts.
