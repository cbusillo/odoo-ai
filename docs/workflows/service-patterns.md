title: Service Layer Patterns (Sources of Truth)
---


## Purpose

Avoid duplicating Owl service examples; point to real code and style docs.

## Sources of Truth

- `docs/style/javascript.md` — JS/Owl conventions.
- `docs/style/owl-components.md` — component patterns.
- `addons/*/static/src/` — actual service usage in this repo.
