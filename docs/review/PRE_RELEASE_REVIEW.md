# Pre-Release Review for Odoo 18 Upgrade

## Overview

This document captures findings from the pre-release code review for the Odoo 18 upgrade. A major refactoring was completed, and we need to ensure:
- No features were lost
- All code follows Odoo 18 patterns
- Shipping implementation is properly planned
- All tests pass and code is production-ready

## Initial Findings

### 1. shopify_is_anonymous Field
- **Status**: Field referenced in test but NOT implemented
- **Location**: `addons/product_connect/services/tests/test_order_importer.py:717-718`
- **Action**: Remove from test - not found in current Shopify API documentation

### 2. Major Refactoring Changes (from migrations)
- **Removed Features**:
  - Technician fields from motors and users (v18.0.5.2)
  - Product import image wizards (v18.0.5.2)
  - Notification history model (v18.0.6.1)
  - Various Shopify configuration parameters (v18.0.6.1)
- **Replaced With**:
  - Notification system → shopify_sync service for logging
  - CRON_IDLE_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD_SECONDS → heartbeat implementation

### Feature Removal Analysis
1. **Technician Fields** - Confirmed removed, no references found
   - Removed from motor and res.users models
   - No UI elements referencing technicians
   - ✓ Clean removal

2. **Product Import Image Wizards** - Replaced by better system
   - Old models: product.import.image.wizard, product.import.image
   - New system uses file_drop_widget and direct image handling
   - ✓ Improved functionality

3. **Notification History** - Integrated into shopify_sync
   - Old standalone model removed
   - Sync records now serve as history/logging
   - ✓ Simplified architecture

4. **Shopify Config Cleanup**
   - shop_url → shop_url_key (better naming)
   - Removed hardcoded API version
   - Removed old cron job (replaced by async sync)
   - ✓ Cleaner configuration

### 3. Shipping Implementation Status
- **Current State**: 
  - `delivery.carrier.service.map` model exists
  - Order importer looks up mappings and errors on unknown methods ✓
  - Basic infrastructure ready for expansion
- **Future Work**: Documented in SHIPPING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

### 4. Uncommitted Changes Summary
- 43 modified files across the project (478 insertions, 182 deletions)
- Key areas: models, tests, services, configurations
- New test files added but not committed
- Removed files: requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt
- Empty migration files in 18.0.6.0 (to be removed)

## Inspection Results

### JetBrains Inspection Findings
- **Errors**: 0 - No critical errors found ✓
- **Warnings**: 8 → 0 - Fixed BaseModel import inconsistency
  - Issue: helpers.py used pydantic.BaseModel while GQL models used custom BaseModel
  - Fixed by updating imports to use consistent BaseModel from gql.base_model
- **Unresolved References**: 0 - All imports resolved ✓

## Code Review Checklist

### Phase 1: Pre-Commit Review ✓
- [x] Review all uncommitted diffs
- [x] Run JetBrains inspection
- [x] Remove shopify_is_anonymous reference

**Ready for commit!**

### Phase 2: Post-Commit Tasks
- [ ] Compare main vs testing branches
- [ ] Full Odoo 18 pattern review
- [ ] Create migration guide
- [ ] Implement shipping solution

## Key Changes Found in Diffs

### 5. ShopifySync Model Changes
- Removed TODO comment for CRON_IDLE_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD_SECONDS
- Enhanced test mode detection with threading check
- Removed some commit() calls in non-test mode

## Review Process Order

1. **Before Commit** (current phase):
   - Review all 43 uncommitted diffs to understand refactoring
   - Run JetBrains inspection
   - Fix critical issues only
   - Document all findings

2. **After Commit**:
   - Compare product_connect between main and testing branches
   - Deep review of every file for Odoo 18 patterns
   - Check for unexpected behavior changes

3. **Separate Change** (future work):
   - Shipping implementation (see SHIPPING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

## Next Steps
1. Complete diff analysis of all 43 modified files
2. Run comprehensive code inspection
3. Fix immediate issues
4. Commit clean baseline
5. Proceed with detailed review
