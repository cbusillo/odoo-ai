Read First

- @docs/agents/refactor.md
- @docs/agents/SUBAGENT_WORKFLOW.md
- @docs/style/TESTING.md

Scope

- Systematic code improvements (renames, codemods, small API shifts).

Rules

- Propose a short plan, then apply changes in small batches.
- Prefer Edit/Write; fall back to Bash hereâ€‘docs for scripted edits when needed.
- Run targeted tests (Bash `uv run test-unit addons/<module>`); evaluate JSON summaries per the Testing Guide; iterate
  until green.
- Save logs under `tmp/subagent-runs/${RUN_ID}/refactor/`.
