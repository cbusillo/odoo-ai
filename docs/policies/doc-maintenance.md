title: Documentation Maintenance
---


## Purpose

Keep docs accurate, concise, and easy for Codex to load. Prefer pointers to
authoritative sources over duplicated guidance.

## Sources of Truth

- `docs/README.md` — documentation index and handles.
- `docs/policies/doc-style.md` — structure and handle conventions.
- `docs/policies/coding-standards.md` — code quality rules.

## Maintenance Checklist

- Update the relevant doc whenever behavior changes.
- Keep docs small; link to code or other docs instead of copying.
- Validate @docs/ handles and local links on touched files.
- Prune stale examples that drift from code.
