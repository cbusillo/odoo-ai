title: Odoo Engineering Patterns (Sources of Truth)
---


## Purpose

Keep engineering guidance anchored to actual code and core Odoo docs.

## Sources of Truth

- `docs/odoo/orm.md` — ORM usage and batching pointers.
- `docs/odoo/security.md` — access rules and controller security.
- `docs/odoo/performance.md` — performance workflow pointers.
- `docs/workflows/odoo-development.md` — development loop and checks.
- `addons/*/models/*.py` and `addons/*/views/*.xml` — real patterns in this repo.
