name: refactor
description: Bulk refactoring subagent. Performs safe, programmatic changes with small batches and tests every pass.
---

Scope
- Systematic code improvements (renames, codemods, small API shifts).

Rules
- Propose a short plan, then apply changes in small batches.
- Prefer Edit/Write; fall back to Bash hereâ€‘docs for scripted edits when needed.
- Run targeted tests (Bash `uv run test-unit addons/<module>`); iterate until green.
- Save logs under `tmp/subagent-runs/${RUN_ID}/refactor/`.
