# Test Infrastructure Fixes Summary

## ✅ Successfully Fixed All 3 Issues

### 1. Tour Test JavaScript Dependencies (HIGH PRIORITY) - FIXED
**Problem**: JavaScript test files failed with "unmet dependencies" due to incorrect asset bundle configuration.

**Root Cause**: Test helper modules were not being loaded in the correct order and bundle configuration was using wildcard patterns that caused loading conflicts.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `addons/product_connect/__manifest__.py` asset configuration
- Created separate `product_connect.test_helpers` bundle for helper modules
- Modified `web.assets_unit_tests` to include helpers first, then specific test files
- Changed from `static/tests/**/*.test.js` to explicit patterns:
  - `static/tests/*.test.js`
  - `static/tests/views/*.test.js`
- Kept `web.assets_tests` for tours only: `static/tests/tours/**/*.js`

**Files Modified**:
- `addons/product_connect/__manifest__.py`

**Verification**: JavaScript tests now load properly without "unmet dependencies" errors.

### 2. Test Database Setup (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - FIXED
**Problem**: Unit test database setup was disabled with `and False` condition in test runner.

**Root Cause**: Line 1005 in `tools/test_runner.py` had database setup disabled with hardcoded `and False`.

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed the `and False` condition from line 1005
- Re-enabled `_setup_unit_test_database()` function for category == "unit"
- Unit tests now create and use isolated `{database}_test` database
- Proper database isolation prevents test contamination

**Files Modified**:
- `tools/test_runner.py` (line 1005 - category gate)

**Verification**: Unit tests now create `opw_test_unit` database and run in isolation.

---

### 3. Test-All Hanging (LOW PRIORITY) - FIXED
**Problem**: Command `uv run test-all` would timeout during initialization when combining all test categories.

**Root Cause**: Running all test categories in a single long session caused initialization conflicts and cross-category interference.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `run_all_tests()` in `tools/test_commands.py`
- Changed from single combined run to sequential execution:
  1. **Phase 1**: Unit tests (clean database, fast)
  2. **Phase 2**: Integration tests (production clone, slow)
  3. **Phase 3**: Tour tests (browser UI, medium speed)
- Each phase runs as separate test session with appropriate timeouts
- Fail-fast behavior: stops at first category failure

**Files Modified**:
- `tools/test_commands.py` (run_all_tests function)

**Verification**: `uv run test-all` now executes without hanging and provides clear phase-by-phase progress.

## Additional Improvements Made

### Enhanced Test Output Management
- Improved progress tracking and stall detection
- Better timeout handling for different test categories
- Enhanced logging for JavaScript/Hoot tests
- Critical error detection and early termination

### Database Management
- Clean test database creation for unit tests
- Proper database cleanup and isolation
- PostgreSQL connection validation
- Container health checks

### Asset Bundle Optimization
- Proper module loading order
- Separated test helpers from test files
- Tour-specific asset bundling
- Reduced JavaScript loading conflicts

## Test Commands Now Working

```bash
# Individual test categories (all working)
uv run test-unit          # Fast unit tests (~3-5 min)
uv run test-integration   # Integration tests (~30 min)  
uv run test-tour         # Browser/tour tests (~15 min)

# Combined execution (fixed - no longer hangs)
uv run test-all          # Sequential: unit → integration → tour

# Legacy modes (maintained compatibility)
python tools/test_runner.py --mixed
python tools/test_runner.py --python
```

## Files Modified

1. **addons/product_connect/__manifest__.py**
   - Fixed JavaScript asset bundle configuration
   - Added proper test helper loading
   - Separated unit tests from tour tests

2. **tools/test_runner.py** 
   - Re-enabled unit test database setup (removed `and False`)
   - Enhanced progress tracking and error detection
   - Improved container management

3. **tools/test_commands.py**
   - Fixed test-all hanging with sequential execution
   - Added phase-by-phase progress reporting

## Verification Results

✅ **JavaScript Dependencies**: No more "unmet dependencies" errors  
✅ **Database Setup**: Unit tests create and use `opw_test_unit` database  
✅ **Test-All Hanging**: Sequential execution completes without hanging  
✅ **All Test Commands**: Work as expected with proper timeouts  
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy test modes still function  

All test infrastructure issues have been resolved and the system is ready for reliable test execution.
