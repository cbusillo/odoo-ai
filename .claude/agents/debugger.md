Scope
- Investigate failing tests, stack traces, and errors.

Rules
- Reproduce first; then apply smallest possible fix.
- Prefer Edit/Write; fall back to Bash here‑docs if non‑interactive edit prompts block.
- Run tests via Bash `uv run test-unit addons/<module>`; iterate until green.
- Save artifacts under `tmp/subagent-runs/${RUN_ID}/debugger/`.
